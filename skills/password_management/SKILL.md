# Skill: password_management

## Purpose

Strengthen password management and account security by identifying weak controls, then producing an actionable remediation plan.
Use a confidential state record as source of truth.
Read schema: `references/confidential_password_state_schema.md`.

## Inputs

- account inventory (email, banking, shopping, cloud, social, work tools)
- current controls (password manager usage, MFA coverage, recovery setup)
- known incidents (phishing, credential leak, device loss)
- optional constraints (budget, migration deadline, user comfort level)
- confidential state file (default: `.private/password_management/current_state.md`)

## Outputs

- risk findings by severity (`critical`, `major`, `minor`, `needs_confirmation`)
- prioritized remediation plan (`now`, `next`, `later`)
- password manager migration checklist
- MFA and account recovery hardening checklist
- updated confidential state record

## Procedure

1. Establish privacy boundary:
   - keep raw account identifiers and secrets in non-tracked locations only
   - never write plaintext passwords, seeds, backup codes, or master password in tracked files
2. Prepare confidential state record:
   - if missing, create `.private/password_management/current_state.md` from `references/confidential_password_state_schema.md`
   - treat the state file as the canonical baseline for this skill
3. Build baseline:
   - inventory high-risk accounts first (email, finance, cloud, admin)
   - map password reuse, weak patterns, and unmanaged accounts
   - map MFA coverage and recovery readiness
4. Score risks:
   - `critical`: single-point compromise paths (primary email without MFA, reused password on critical accounts)
   - `major`: exploitable but partially mitigated issues
   - `minor`: hygiene improvements
   - `needs_confirmation`: missing evidence
5. Plan remediation:
   - `now`: remove reuse on critical accounts, enable MFA, secure primary email
   - `next`: migrate remaining accounts to password manager, replace weak passwords
   - `later`: optimize passkey adoption and periodic audits
6. Generate operational checklists:
   - onboarding sequence for password manager
   - emergency recovery flow for lost device or locked account
   - periodic review cadence (monthly quick check, quarterly deep audit)
7. Persist updates:
   - update `.private/password_management/current_state.md` with changed status
   - store dated snapshots in `.private/password_management/history/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for traceability
   - if sharing in-repo, publish redacted summary only

## Rules

- Do not ask users to disclose existing passwords.
- Prefer unique random passwords generated by password manager for non-passkey accounts.
- Prioritize protection of primary email and financial accounts.
- Prefer phishing-resistant MFA when possible.
- Mark assumptions explicitly when data is missing.

## Failure Handling

- If account inventory is incomplete, produce a minimum inventory template first.
- If user cannot adopt a password manager immediately, provide staged fallback with explicit risk trade-offs.
- If organizational policy conflicts with recommendations, document policy-first constraints and revise plan.
