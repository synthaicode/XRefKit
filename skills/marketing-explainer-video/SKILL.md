description: Create repository-ready marketing explainer videos from a message flow using staged slide reveals, dialogue-style narration, HTML/CSS slide rendering, TTS audio, licensing credits, preview pages, and README/video placement. Use when Codex is asked to make or revise a short explanatory video, overview video, narrated slide video, Japanese/English marketing video, or README-linked product video.

# Marketing Explainer Video

## Purpose

Create short marketing explainer videos that are understandable to first-time viewers. Use a question-then-explanation structure, reveal slide content in sync with narration, and ship reproducible source files with the final MP4.

## Inputs

- target audience and purpose
- message flow or rough script
- language and target voices
- assets directory and video directory
- TTS engine choice such as VOICEVOX, Azure Speech, or silent preview
- required credits and license text
- desired publication target such as README, docs page, or release artifact

## Outputs

- `render.mjs` and `diagram.css`
- per-state `*.html` and `*.png` slide assets
- `manifest.tsv` with slide order and narration
- preview `index.html`
- build script for silent or TTS video
- final `*.mp4`
- README or docs link update when requested

## Story Design

- Define the core term early, within the first two or three slides.
- Use a clear progression: problem -> attempted solution -> new human burden -> next structure.
- Make each step answer what changed for humans, not only what changed technically.
- Before locking slide order, write one bridge line per step:
  - what the viewer understands now
  - what question or doubt remains
  - what the next slide resolves
- If a slide needs a concept that has not been introduced yet, add a setup slide
  instead of hiding the jump inside narration.
- Add at least one concrete example and one Before / After slide.
- Avoid explaining implementation brands or internal repository names unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use short question-only states before full explanation states so viewers can follow the narration.
- Remove visible speaker labels when voice and timing already distinguish roles.

## Slide Construction

- Use the `marketing_slide_png` pattern for CSS/HTML-rendered PNG slides.
- Keep each slide state to one visual message.
- Prefer `*_q` filenames for question-only states and the base filename for the revealed explanation state.
- Keep text large enough for video playback; verify full slides, not just HTML.
- Use summary bars for the lasting point, but avoid overlapping them with main content.
- When translating, re-balance text length and font sizes instead of preserving Japanese layout sizes blindly.

## Narration and Pacing

- Write narration in dialogue form when the topic can feel abstract.
- Put one narration turn per row in `manifest.tsv`.
- Add short pauses after questions and after explanation slides.
- Avoid monotone pacing by alternating:
  - question-only state
  - explanation reveal
  - flow or comparison slide
  - summary slide
- If the slide already contains both question and explanation, split it into two states.

## TTS

- Keep secrets in environment variables. Never write API keys into scripts or manifests.
- For VOICEVOX, include explicit credit slides and final visible credit text for all voices used.
- For Azure Speech, read `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` and `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` from the environment.
- Use different voices for question and answer roles when available.
- Generate segment videos from still PNG + audio, then concatenate and re-encode the final MP4 to avoid timestamp/fps issues.

## Licensing

- Add a final credit slide when the audio engine or voice model requires attribution.
- Include visible voice credits in the video, not only in README text.
- Keep generated intermediate audio and segment files out of commits unless explicitly requested.
- Commit final MP4, source scripts, manifests, slide assets, and preview files.

## Verification

- Render HTML, then capture PNGs with Playwright or the repository's established screenshot method.
- Inspect representative PNGs, especially:
  - title slide
  - dense definition slide
  - concrete example slide
  - Before / After slide
  - license/credit slide
- Check scenario continuity before polishing visuals:
  - no term appears before it is set up
  - no conclusion appears before the problem and failed alternative are visible
  - each slide can answer why it follows the previous slide
- Build the MP4 and verify:
  - resolution
  - fps
  - duration
  - final file path
  - audio is present when TTS is expected
- Run repository checks such as `python -m fm xref fix` after adding Markdown or documentation links.

## Publication

- If the video is for README playback, prefer a root-level `readme.mp4` or a GitHub raw URL.
- Keep README copy short and benefit-led.
- When committing, stage only the intended video package. Leave unrelated dirty worktree changes untouched.
