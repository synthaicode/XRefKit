# Knowledge Index (domain canonical)

This folder stores shared domain knowledge fragments.
Skills should reference these pages by XID and load only what is needed.

## Rules

- Keep one fragment per coherent topic.
- Preserve XID blocks.
- Use links with `#xid-...` for cross-fragment references.
- After edits, run `python -m fm xref fix`.
