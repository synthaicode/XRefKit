# Work Area (AI-authored retrospectives)

This folder stores AI-authored execution logs and retrospectives.

- Canonical operational docs: `docs/`
- Canonical domain knowledge: `knowledge/`
- Skill definitions: `skills/`

Humans do not need to manually maintain this area.
AI writes to `work/` for traceability and handover, then promotes stable outputs
to canonical folders when ready.

Recommended structure:

- `work/sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<topic>.md`
- `work/retrospectives/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<topic>.md`
- `work/handover/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<topic>.md`
