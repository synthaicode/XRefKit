description: filemanager XID/link contract
alwaysApply: true
---

This repo uses XID as the primary key for cross-doc references.

- Always start from `docs/000_index.md` (human entry) and `agent/000_agent_entry.md` (agent contract).
- References must include `#xid-...` fragments (paths may change).
- Never change or remove existing XID blocks (`<!-- xid: ... -->` and `<a id="xid-..."></a>`).
- Do not guess missing information; use `python -m fm xref search` / `python -m fm xref show`.
- After edits, run: `python -m fm xref init`, `python -m fm xref rewrite`, `python -m fm xref check`.
